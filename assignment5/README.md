---------------
### what is data analysis
#### A method for reviewing, purifying, modeling, and changing data in order to find relevant information, support judgment, and support decision-making.

### What are data analysis Tools
*Auto-managed closed tools*
#### 1.Qlikq

#### 2.tableau

#### 3.looker

#### Closed Source, Expensive, Limited, Easy to learn.

### Programming Languages
*1.python*

*2.R*

*3.julia*

open Source, Free (or very cheap), Extremely Powerful, steep learning curve.

### Why Python for Data Analysis?
1. Very simple and intuitive to learn
2. “correct” language
3. Powerful libraries (not just for Data Analysis)
3. Free and open source
4. Amazing community, docs and conferences
### When to choose R?
1.When R Studio is needed 
2.When dealing with advanced statistical methods 
3.When extreme performance is needed

The Method of Data Analysis
Data extraction, data cleaning, data wrangling, analysis, and action are the steps in data analysis.

The libraries we use...
1.Pandas: The cornerstone of our Data Analysis job with Python

2.Matplotlib: The foundational library for visualizations. Other libraries we’ll use will be built on top of matplotlib.

3.Numpy: The numeric library that serves as the foundation of all calculations in Python.

4.Seaborn: A statistical visualization tool built on top of matplotlib.

5.Statsmodels: A library with many advanced statistical functions.

6.Scipy: Advanced scientific computing, including functions for optimization, linear algebra, image processing and much more.

7.Scikit-learn: The most popular machine learning library for Python (not deep learning)
